## Intro
  
This is a framework for Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN-LM) models implemented in Pytorch.  
This language model can be combined with tasks such as speech recognition or machine translation etc...    
We appreciate any kind of feedback or contribution.

### Code Style
  
I follow PEP-8 for code style. Especially the style of docstrings is important to generate documentation.
