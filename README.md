## Intro
  
This is a project for Character-level Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (Rnnlm) implemented in [Pytorch](pytorch.org).  
This language model can be combined with tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, image captioning etc..   
We appreciate any kind of feedback or contribution.

## Installation
This project recommends Python 3.7 or higher.   
I recommend creating a new virtual environment for this project (using virtualenv or conda).  

### Prerequisites
  
* Numpy: `pip install numpy` (Refer [here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) for problem installing Numpy).
* Pandas: `pip install pandas` (Refer [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) for problem installing Pandas)
* PyTorch: Refer to [PyTorch website](http://pytorch.org/) to install the version w.r.t. your environment.
  
  
## Troubleshoots and Contributing
  
If you have any questions, bug reports, and feature requests, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sooftware/RNN-LM/issues) on Github.  
or Contacts sh951011@gmail.com please.  

I appreciate any kind of feedback or contribution. Feel free to proceed with small issues like bug fixes, documentation improvement. For major contributions and new features, please discuss with the collaborators in corresponding issues.
  
### Code Style
  
We follow PEP-8 for code style. Especially the style of docstrings is important to generate documentation.
